##   Scenario Overview

The incident happened around 4:30 PM on Friday, "The Last day of the week" at the Accounts/Marketing department of "Finance XYZ" company. There weren't many people in the department, and the remaining were not paying much attention to their surroundings as they were getting ready to head home. After the weekend on Monday while reviewing the security cam footage member of an IT team saw "Eddie" a new intern in the Accounts/Marketing department, plugging a USB into an unauthorized computer (containing sensitive financial and marketing documents), interacting with computer and unplugging the USB before heading out. As the incident happened 2 days ago, and not having enough knowledge of what Eddie did the security team use caution while asking around and gathering intel to avoid causing suspicion. The only information they were able to find out was that Eddie had a "Toshiba" USB. You are provided with a partial image of the “unauthorized computer" as well as a list of important documents, to investigate what he did and if he stole something sensitive or not?).

###  Summary

An internal data exfiltration incident occurred at Finance XYZ on a quiet Friday around 4:30 PM. Security footage later revealed Eddie, a new intern, inserting a Toshiba USB drive into an unauthorized computer and interacting with it briefly. Forensic investigation using tools like FTK Imager, Registry Explorer, and Eric Zimmerman’s suite confirmed the system timezone as UTC+05:00, with the logged-in user identified as MrManj. Three USB storage devices were recognized, with the Toshiba device connected from 2024-02-23 11:37:50 to 11:39:12 UTC. Analysis of LNK files revealed Eddie copied the “Documents” folder to the USB, including the subfolder “Business Proposals”, and accessed files like “Business Leads.xlsx” and “Proposal Brnrdr ltd.docx”. The USB volume name was RVT-9J, mounted as drive E. Thumbcache analysis uncovered an image revealing Eddie’s last name as Homer. The USB was identified via VID/PID as a generic device from Shenzhen SanDiYiXin Electronic Co., LTD, strengthening the evidence of unauthorized data access.
